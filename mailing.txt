Hi everybody,

I'm proposing to the GDAL community an utility program that I've made for my needs: gdal_rename.
I designed it to rename a raster dataset with it's CRS coordinates (including it's world files tfw...).
Orginialy it was made to rename tiled datasets downloaded from many sources to have consistent namming pattern
or to update the name after a CRS change with gdalwarp.
So you can choose a prefix, a corner (W/N by default) of the bounding box of the dataset which coordinate
will be used to rename the file, a separator for coordinate value, the numeric format of coordinates (integer, double) and sign.

As an example:

I've downloaded the Orthophoto of French administrative area "Bouches-du-Rh√¥nes" on the French National Geographique Institut Open Data website.
For this dataset the tiles are named with the pattern "13-2014-XXXX-YYYY-LA93-5M00-E100.jp2".
So for the tile named 13-2014-0820-6300-LA93-5M00-E100.jp2 (bounding box 820000.0 6290000.0 830000.0 6300000.0 in French Lambert 93 CRS)
I can rename it:
	- "0820000-6300000.jp2" with the following command: gdal_rename -l 7 -z -t "int" -s "-" ".\13-2014-0820-6300-LA93-5M00-E100.jp2"	
	- "Whatever_N6300-E0830_I_want.jp2" with the following command: gdal_rename -r "NW" -p "Whatever_" -l 4 -z -t "int" -g "geo" -s "-" -x "_I_want" ".\13-2014-0820-6300-LA93-5M00-E100.jp2"	

In my opinion it is only make sens to use top/left or bottom/left corner of the bounding box, however I let the ability
to use any corner of the dataset 

It is renaming only one file at a time so you'll need to use a "forfiles" on windows batch or "find" on linux bash
to rename the content of a folder.

I almost try to respect the GDAL naming convention, and to use the CPL, VSIL helpers for maximum compatibilities purpose.
However I've compiled it only on windows with msvc compiler for now.
I'll try the gcc on debian as soon as possible.

You can check the repository here for the source and the usage of the app:

If you think it can be helpfull to add it to the gdal utilities release feel free.

Best Regards.
